# Gavel
 - What is Gavel? Gavel is mighty tool for HTTP API hits validation and introspection.  
      - Complex assert library for matching executed HTTP hit againts its declaration by:
        - Example headers
        - Textual example
        - JSON example
        - JSON schema
      - Bored of writing tons of asserts for each single API call in your integration tests?
      - Test HTTP API client request to API and backend server's response against its API documentation.
      - It compares request payload from client to backend server and its response to the client
      - Assertion is defined by payload content
      - Main purpose is use Gavel to test API documentation written in API Blueprint format against backend implementation during whole project's life-time.
      - Assure API documentation all-the-time validity by binding it with project's lifecycle and plugging it into the CI process.
      - Portability
      - This behavior documentation is language agnostic
      - javascript reference implementation
      - Brief behavior:
        - headers can't miss
        - header values metters
        - textual body must match exactly 
        - JSON keys can't be missing
